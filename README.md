Energy Predictor I II ( GEPIII) machine l earning competition on the Kaggle platform


Problem Description:
This competitionâ€™s overall objective was to find the most accurate modelling solutions for the
prediction of metered building energy usage i n the f ollowing areas: chilled water, electric, hot
water, a nd steam meters. The competitors were provided with over 20 million points of training
