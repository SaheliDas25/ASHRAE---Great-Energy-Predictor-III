# ASHRAE---Great-Energy-Predictor-III

Overview:
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) is an
American p rofessional association seeking to advance h eating, ventilation, air conditioning and
refrigeration ( HVAC&R) systems design and construction. I n l ate 2019, ASHRAE hosted the Great
Energy Predictor I II ( GEPIII) machine l earning competition on the Kaggle platform


Problem Description:
This competitionâ€™s overall objective was to find the most accurate modelling solutions for the
prediction of metered building energy usage i n the f ollowing areas: chilled water, electric, hot
water, a nd steam meters. The competitors were provided with over 20 million points of training
data from 2,380 energy meters collected for 1,448 buildings from 16 sources. The data comes
from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe.

Dataset: Dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data

Dataset Development:
A majority of the data sites were universities; therefore, the most common building type i s
education. The primary use type of buildings corresponds to the categories found i n the
EnergyStar building benchmarking system. Around 73% of the data were from buildings on
university campus sites (1058 buildings) and the remaining 27% of the sites were from city-wide
municipal and healthcare building repositories ( 390 buildings)
